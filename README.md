# API  | Assignment - What's the Weather Like?

## Background


Creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

#Run down:
*The following were used: matplotlib, pandas, numpy, requests, time on Jupyter notebook.
*Performed a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls (was able to call API)
* Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
* The city data is generated based on random coordinates


 Objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
